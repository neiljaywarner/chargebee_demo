# Atomic Commit 1 â€” Proof Review

Artifacts to review:
- Widget test proof: run `flutter test test/patrol_widget_test.dart -r expanded` (should pass)
- Maestro proof (screenshots + optional video):
  - Run: `RECORD=1 bash scripts/maestro_run.sh` or `bash scripts/maestro_record.sh`
  - Screenshots: `artifacts/screenshots/maestro_before.png` and `artifacts/screenshots/maestro_after.png`
  - Video (if RECORD=1 or via maestro_record.sh): `artifacts/videos/` (timestamped recording)
  - Logs: `artifacts/logs/maestro.log` or `artifacts/logs/maestro_record.log`

What to look for:
- Before screenshot shows initial screen with Subscription ID field and button
- After screenshot shows a card with `Status: active` (visual proof)
- Widget test output shows passing assertion for `Status: active`
