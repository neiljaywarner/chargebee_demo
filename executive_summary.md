Objective:
Demonstrate a Chargebee integration demo that confirms a user's active subscription using a Flutter app with Riverpod architecture, Freezed models, and black-box testing.

Pitch:
- Value: Show how teams can build a thin client on top of Chargebee’s REST API without being locked into dashboard-only workflows. This empowers custom UX, offline strategies, and multi-channel surfaces while keeping the integration maintainable.
- Approach: Clean repository/controller architecture (inspired by codewithandrea.com), strong contracts via Freezed/JSON, and black-box E2E harness (BDD/Maestro/Patrol/ADB). Start with mock (near-the-wire Fake Dio), then wire to sandbox.

Work left for a real app:
- Auth: real login and secure token/key management (env/secure storage)
- More endpoints: list subscriptions, manage plans, update payment methods
- Error and retry policies; observability
- CI integration (Maestro Cloud or self-hosted devices)
- iOS device coverage and App Store policies

Usefulness of this demo:
- High for stakeholder demos and onboarding—clear UI, testable E2E, and progressive path to production.
- Serves as a template repo for future integrations with similar patterns.
