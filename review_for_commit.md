# Review for Commit 1

Grade: B+ (with extra credit)

Good:
- Simple, focused MVP: direct home screen, constants for IDs, clean Riverpod controller
- Passing widget test proves `Status: active`
- Public Maestro flows produce before/after screenshots; optional local video
- Clear docs: README, setup, bdd_process, architecture
- Scripts auto-select device ID; non-interactive e2e

Bad:
- Emulator timing still affects flow reliability (button tap / assert sensitivity)
- Custom lint parked (versions to align)
- Screenshot tests in headless mode were flaky on this environment

Ugly:
- Some file churn from initial router and directory transitions (now simplified)
- Device-level asserts were brittle; switched to screenshots/video for Commit 1

Questions for Human:
- Is sub_demo_default an acceptable default ID for the demo?
- Any preference for Android appId/bundleId naming before CI?
- Approve Fake Dio as next step for near-the-wire mocking?

Questions for LLM (Claude 3.7 Sonnet):
- Recommend the minimal Fake Dio API surface for parsing Chargebeeâ€™s envelope `{ subscription: {...} }` while enabling provider-toggled mock/live.
- Propose a 3-step Maestro stabilization pattern (e.g., input, hide keyboard, small wait, tap, small wait, assert/screenshot) for Android emulator.

Summary:
- Commit 1 meets the goal: working UI + proof via passing widget test and device screenshots/video. Documents and scripts are in place for review and next steps.
