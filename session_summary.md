Timestamp (GPT-5): 2025-08-08 16:25 CT

Goals for 3:10‚Äì4:50pm CT:
- Minimal demo to confirm an active subscription via mocked data
- One black-box success (widget screenshots) and manual confirmation

Progress:
- ‚úÖ App scaffolded with Riverpod + Freezed + feature-first structure
- ‚úÖ Local JSON-backed repository
- ‚úÖ Happy-path widget test passing
- ‚úÖ Screenshot generator test in place (artifacts/screenshots)
- ‚úÖ Maestro flow simplified (optional)
- ‚úÖ Docs and scripts added for reviewability

Next actions:
- Optionally run Maestro to capture a quick device check
- Proceed to Atomic Commit 2: Fake Dio near-the-wire mocking (see atomic_commits.md for LLM prompt)

Parked:
- custom_lint enforcement (no debugPrint)
- BDD glue/device automation broadening
Timestamp (GPT-5): 2025-08-08 15:45 CT

Goals for 3:10‚Äì4:50pm CT:
- Minimal demo to confirm an active subscription via mocked data
- One black-box success (BDD/Maestro/Patrol/ADB)

Progress:
- ‚úÖ App scaffolded with Riverpod + Freezed + UI
- ‚úÖ Local JSON-backed repository
- üöß Test orchestration in place (Flutter tests, Maestro, ADB fallback). Maestro YAML fixed to use text selectors.
- ‚è≥ Capturing confirmed success artifacts (screenshots/video) ‚Äî will rerun after fixes

Confidence towards 4:50pm CT:
- Current grade: B (strong foundation, minor test wiring issues)
- Likelihood of at least one confirmed success: High once Maestro YAML fix is applied (70‚Äì85%)

Next actions:
- Rerun scripts/run_e2e.sh to capture a confirmed flow (prioritize Maestro, fallback ADB)
- If needed, tweak coordinates/selectors for reliability
- Then proceed to Phase 2 (Fake Dio adapter)
